# YouTube Bypass
This extension:
1. Changes your User-Agent string on YouTube to be like a Windows Phone. For some reason, those don't have the ad block ban.
2. Makes m.youtube.com/* redirect to youtube.com/*?app=desktop, so that you can still use the desktop layout.

It is recommended to have an ad blocker alongside this, although the Windows Phone user-agent doesn't load most of them (you'll find outliers in search results).
